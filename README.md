# BuildCraft Community Edition

## About the project

BuildCraft Community Edition combines the newer foundation of **BuildCraft 8.0.0** with mechanics that were present in **BuildCraft 7.1.27** but were not completed or carried over into BC8, including robotics and building-related features.

The goal of the project is to preserve and continue the classic BuildCraft experience on newer Minecraft versions, restoring missing content and completing unfinished ideas from the original mod without changing its core identity.

## Supported versions

| Minecraft | Loader |
| --- | --- |
| 1.19.2 | Forge |
| 1.20.1 | Forge |
| 1.21.1 | NeoForge |
| 1.21.11 | NeoForge |
| 26.1.2 | NeoForge |
| 26.3 | NeoForge (beta) |

## Roadmap 2.0

- [x] Drop support for 1.21.1 Forge
- [x] Introduce the new API v2 system
- [x] Add Forge Energy (FE) compatibility
- [x] Port to 1.21.11 NeoForge
- [x] Port to 26.x NeoForge
- [ ] Introduce API v2.1 extension
- [ ] Port to 1.20.1 Fabric
- [ ] Port to 1.21.1 Fabric
- [ ] Port to 1.21.11 Fabric
- [ ] Port to 26.x Fabric

## API v2

BCCE includes a new **API v2** intended to provide a stable, loader-neutral surface for addons and integrations.

Loader-specific implementation details stay outside the public API, while common concepts such as energy, pipes, robotics, schematics, statements, automation and debugging are exposed through shared contracts. Forge Energy support is integrated without making the public API depend on Forge or NeoForge classes.

The long-term goal is to make addons easier to maintain across BCCE's supported Minecraft versions and future loader ports.

## Multi-version build and source architecture

BCCE has three active Stonecutter/Gradle build generations:

- **old** — Minecraft 1.19.2 and 1.20.1;
- **1.21.X** — Minecraft 1.21.1 and 1.21.11;
- **26.X** — Minecraft 26.1.2 and 26.3.

Each generation has its own Gradle Wrapper and Stonecutter controller under `builds/<generation>`.

Every target is assembled from five source layers, with each later layer able to override an earlier one:

```text
source-shared
+ source-families/<family>
+ source-platforms/<loader>
+ source-family-platforms/<family>/<loader>
+ version-src/<target>
```

Small Minecraft-version differences may use localized Stonecutter conditions inside family/family-platform files. Loader-wide code belongs in `source-platforms`; loader code tied to one source family belongs in `source-family-platforms`. `version-src` is reserved for irreducible target-specific files and resources. Per-target metadata is centralized in `build-config/targets.properties`.

The 1.19.2 implementation is the gameplay reference, but source code is allowed to differ when newer Minecraft APIs require another implementation. The compatibility target is player-visible behaviour: **different implementation, indistinguishable BuildCraft**.

CI builds and tests each maintained target independently. Every target has its own build, GameTest, dedicated-server smoke and client smoke run, while cross-target architecture and parity checks remain global.

See [`SOURCE_FAMILIES.md`](SOURCE_FAMILIES.md) for layout rules, parity policy and build commands.

## Issue reports
