# BuildCraft build generations and hybrid source layout

BuildCraft Community Edition uses three independent Gradle/Stonecutter builds and one shared source repository.

The project has one gameplay goal across every supported target:

> **Different implementation. Indistinguishable BuildCraft.**

Minecraft versions, loaders and build toolchains are implementation details. Unless a deviation is explicitly documented, players should not be able to identify the target from BuildCraft gameplay, balance, persistence, UI behaviour, machine timing, routing, permissions or resource handling.

## Build generations

### `old`

Current targets:

- `1.19.2-forge`
- `1.20.1-forge`

Build root: `builds/old`

The old build owns ForgeGradle-era targets and currently uses its own Gradle 8 wrapper. `1.19.2-forge` remains the behaviour reference; newer implementations are not required to look identical in source.

### `1.21.X`

Current targets:

- `1.21.1-neoforge`
- `1.21.11-neoforge`

Planned targets include 1.21.11 Fabric.

Build root: `builds/1.21.X`

The 1.21.X wrapper is independent from the old wrapper. It may move to a newer Gradle, Stonecutter or Java toolchain when its Minecraft/Fabric/NeoForge versions require it, without forcing those requirements onto the old build.

If a source family requires an incompatible toolchain, give it an independent build generation instead of forcing every version through one wrapper or filling gameplay code with large condition blocks.

### `26.X`

Current targets:

- `26.1.2-neoforge`
- `26.3-neoforge` (NeoForge beta). Mechanical 26.3 API renames live in `upgrade_263_symbols` (`scripts/transforms/java_compat.py`); owned replacements for removed APIs live in `buildcraft.lib.compat.mc263`. See `PORTING_26.3.md`.

Build root: `builds/26.X`

The 26.X build uses Java 25 and its own NeoForge/ModDevGradle toolchain. It shares the same repository-level source architecture and parity rules as the older generations while keeping toolchain requirements isolated.

```

A target is materialized from the same five ownership layers. Older targets may additionally insert a downport view immediately after the family or family-platform owner:

```text
shared
→ family canonical
→ optional family downport
→ platform
→ family-platform canonical
→ optional family-platform downport
→ target escape hatch
```

Downports are not a new ownership axis: they are explicit older-Minecraft views of the canonical source owned by that family/family-platform. The 1.21.X canonical Java API is currently **1.21.11**. `1.21.1-neoforge` consumes explicit downports only where the canonical 1.21.11 implementation cannot be shared unchanged.

The generated effective tree is created under the target subproject's `build/effective-source` directory. It is build output, not authoritative source.

The Python side is deliberately split by responsibility:

- `scripts/source_layout.py` — generic layer resolution/materialization only;
- `scripts/source_config.py` — canonical target registry and layer ownership;
- `scripts/source_preprocessor.py` — `//?` condition parsing only;
- `scripts/transforms/` — path-independent mechanical Java/resource transforms only.

Class-specific Java rewriting is forbidden. `scripts/transforms/java_compat.py` may only perform mechanical API-shape/symbol conversion and must not name BuildCraft source files. Native 1.21.11 implementations live in maintained family/family-platform ownership; explicit 1.21.1 downports preserve the older 1.21.X target without making `version-src` an ownership axis.

## Placement rules

Choose the narrowest layer that represents the real reason for a difference.

### `source-shared`

Use for code and resources that are valid for every supported target.

### `source-families/<family>`

Use for substantial Minecraft-generation differences shared by every target in one build generation. Examples include serialization models, registry architecture, networking generations or broad rendering/API changes.

### `source-platforms/<loader>`

Use for loader APIs and integration points that are reusable across source families, including:

- Forge, NeoForge or Fabric registration;
- capabilities or transfer APIs;
- loader lifecycle and events;
- loader networking setup;
- access transformers/access wideners;
- loader metadata and loader-specific compatibility glue.

Loader imports must not escape into `source-shared` or `source-families`. A Java file in `source-platforms/<loader>` must actually reference that loader API; loader-neutral Java stranded in a platform layer is rejected by the source-layout validator and must be promoted to shared/family ownership.

### `source-family-platforms/<family>/<loader>`

Use when code is genuinely loader-specific **and** tied to one source family. This is the normal home for a NeoForge/Fabric implementation whose API shape changes between source families such as `old`, `1.21.X` and `26.X`. It overrides the generic platform layer without forcing a complete target copy.

A family-platform layer may explicitly own a loader-neutral prefix when that subtree must be selected atomically with loader-specific siblings. Such exceptions are declared with `source.family_platform.<family>.<loader>.allow_loader_neutral` in `build-config/common.properties` and remain visible to the architecture budget validator. Unlisted loader-neutral files are still rejected.

### Loader-neutral network boundary

Gameplay and internal module code use `BCPacketContext` and `BCNetworkSide`. Forge and NeoForge packet contexts are converted exactly at the networking boundary by `ForgePacketContext` and `NeoForgePacketContext`; raw `NetworkEvent.Context`, `IPayloadContext` and loader-side enums must not leak into shared/family gameplay. The transport/registration implementation remains loader-owned.

### `source-downports/<family>/<minecraft>/...`

Use only when the canonical family/family-platform Java is written against the newest supported Minecraft API and an older target needs a substantially different complete implementation. Downports contain no `//?` directives and are selected by target configuration, not by loader predicates. Prefer a small compat facade or a short inline version condition when that is clearer than a full downport.

### `version-src/<target>`

Use only when a complete file or resource is genuinely target-specific and cannot remain readable in a family/platform layer. Target overlays should stay small and must not contain inline version conditions. For `1.21.11-neoforge`, the only remaining Java exception is the frozen API file `buildcraft/api/v2/recipe/CountedIngredient.java`; API restructuring is intentionally outside the architecture migration.

## Internal actors, permissions and client registration

`buildcraft.api` is unchanged. Permission decisions still call the existing API2
service. `BCPermissions` is an internal service integration, not a new claims
system; the saved owner UUID identifies the actor rather than restricting access
to a machine to its owner. The previous `AutomationPermissionUtil` remains a
compatibility facade for existing callers.

`BCActors` owns the per-world/per-profile actor cache. `PlatformActors` creates
Forge or NeoForge fake players; the 1.20+ no-sign-editor implementation and online
advancement-owner repair are retained. `withTool` scopes position and main-hand
state and restores them on nested calls or exceptions, without copying the tool
and losing legitimate durability changes. World unload evicts cached actors.
Native break/place protection events and canceled-placement snapshot restoration
belong in `PlatformWorldActions`.

`BCChunkTickets` owns work-area comparison, config decisions and release logic.
`PlatformChunkTickets` owns native callback registration and forcing. Ticket keys
remain the loading block position and the existing mod/controller ID. World
unload discards the in-memory mirror but must not unforce persistent tickets;
machine removal releases both old non-ticking and current ticking forms.

Client catalogues use `ClientRegistration`: menu-screen factories, entity/block
entity renderer factories, colours and applicable render-layer settings.
`PlatformClientRegistration` binds them to the native lifecycle. Forge screen
registration is queued exactly once; NeoForge's menu event is immediate. Native
event subscriber classes remain loader-owned and client-only.

Model and atlas implementations receive `ClientModelBaking` and `ClientAtlas`
views rather than loader event objects. Views keep the actual bake maps and
atlas instance; mutating a detached copy would silently lose model replacement.
On 1.21.11, `ClientStandaloneModel` rebinds its native lookup on each standalone
registration and resolves it from that generation's model manager. These views
replace registration plumbing, not the renderer/model algorithms. Loader-native
geometry loaders and fluid client extensions remain loader bindings by design.

Run `python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p test_actor_client_boundaries.py -v`
for the four-target actor/ticket and client-registration contract suite. It uses
real boundary classes with small native API doubles and stored catalogue
snapshots; a real Gradle compile and client/server runtime acceptance are still
separate requirements.

## Whole-file source variants

A complete native implementation that belongs to a maintained family or family-platform layer but only exists from a Minecraft API boundary may use a first-line source selector:

```java
//? source if >=1.21.11
package buildcraft.example;
```

The selector is structural metadata, not emitted Java. If it is disabled for a target, materialization falls back to the next lower layer at the same logical path. A selected whole-file variant is already native to that Minecraft API and bypasses mechanical upgrade transforms.

Use whole-file selectors only in `source-families` or `source-family-platforms`. Do not put loader predicates in them; loader ownership is represented by the directory tree. Do not use them in `source-shared`, `source-platforms` or `version-src`.

This is intended for a genuinely different complete implementation. Small API differences still belong in localized `//? if ...` blocks, and repeated API cliffs should move behind a compat facade.

## Localized version conditions

Small Minecraft API differences may remain in a family or platform file with Stonecutter-style directives. The effective-source generator evaluates them for each target before compilation.

Example:

```java
//? if <1.20 {
player.level
//?} else {
/*?
player.level()
?*/
//?}
```

Use inline conditions for local differences such as:

- renamed methods, fields, constants or enum values;
- a small signature change;
- an added argument or import;
- a short alternative branch.

Do not use inline conditions for loader selection. Loader differences belong in `source-platforms` or `source-family-platforms`.

Current policy enforced by `scripts/validate-source-families.py`:

1. no loader conditions in shared/family gameplay source;
2. no inline conditions in target overlays;
3. large conditional counts are reported as architecture drift and belong in compat/family-platform implementations;
4. byte-identical overrides are rejected;
5. every configured target must successfully preprocess every conditional file;
6. `scripts/source_layout.py` is kept generic and may not contain BuildCraft-class-specific rewrites.

## Behaviour parity

`1.19.2-forge` is the reference implementation for player-visible behaviour.

Parity means equivalent observable results, not source-code identity. It includes:

- machine speed, costs, capacity and refunds;
- MJ generation, consumption and routing;
- item/fluid pipe routing and filtering;
- Builder, Filler and Quarry behaviour;
- robots, boards, stations and ownership identity;
- gates, wires, lasers and statements;
- save/load and chunk-unload persistence;
- permission/protection behaviour;
- blueprint contents and resource reservations;
- GUI semantics and user interactions.

A target may use different data components, registries, network APIs, events, capabilities or transfer systems as long as the observable BuildCraft behaviour remains equivalent.

### Blind-room criterion

> Put players on different supported BCCE targets in separate rooms, hide Minecraft/loader information, and give them equivalent BuildCraft scenarios. They should not be able to identify the target from BuildCraft behaviour alone.

A visible difference is either an intentional and documented vanilla-induced deviation or a parity regression.

## Build commands

The effective-source generator requires Python 3. Gradle, Java and loader toolchains remain isolated inside their respective build generation.

Build every generation with its own wrapper:

```text
./build-all.sh
```

Windows:

```text
build-all.bat
```

PowerShell:

```text
./build-all.ps1
```

Build only one generation:

```text
cd builds/old
./gradlew buildAndCollect
```

```text
cd builds/1.21.X
./gradlew buildAndCollect
```

Run the active target of one generation:

```text
cd builds/old
./gradlew runActiveClient
```

```text
cd builds/1.21.X
./gradlew runActiveClient
```

List configured targets:

```text
python scripts/validate-stonecutter.py --list-targets
python scripts/validate-stonecutter.py --list-targets --generation old
python scripts/validate-stonecutter.py --list-targets --generation 1.21.X
```

Validate the complete architecture:

```text
python scripts/validate-stonecutter.py
python scripts/validate-source-families.py
python scripts/validate-repository-cleanliness.py
python scripts/validate-behavior-parity.py
```

Materialize one target manually:

```text
python scripts/source_layout.py 1.20.1-forge --output build/manual/1.20.1-forge
```

## Adding targets

1. Add the target once to `build-config/targets.properties` and assign `build.generation`, `source.family` and `source.platform`.
2. Reuse the existing build-root selector; only add a new build root when the toolchain truly requires one.
3. Reuse `source-shared`, the family, platform and family-platform layers.
4. Add only irreducible files to `version-src/<target>`.
5. Prefer a small version condition or a focused compat facade over copying a large gameplay class.
6. A new loader gets a `build-logic/loaders/<loader>-target.gradle` adapter plus platform/family-platform implementations; gameplay code should not be copied.

Do not create another full source-tree copy for a new port.

## Internal Minecraft compatibility boundaries

`buildcraft.lib.compat.minecraft` is internal implementation code, not an addon API.
The public `buildcraft.api` tree is outside these internal compatibility-boundary rules.
The boundaries serve modern target families; the old family keeps its established
effective-source layout.

| Boundary | Responsibilities and current consumers |
| --- | --- |
| `persistence` | `BCBlockEntity` owns the vanilla load/save callbacks. Machines implement `readData(BCValueInput)` and `writeData(BCValueOutput)`; `TileBC_Neptune` supplies common owner/item/tank/delta hooks. |
| `gui` | `BCContainerScreen` translates native input, `BCInputState` scopes modifiers, `BCWidgetInput` identifies internal recipe panels, and `BCGraphics`/`BCGuiTooltip` handle matrix, texture and tooltip submission differences. |
| `render` | `BCGeometryRenderer` dispatches immediate geometry on 1.21.1 and immutable captured geometry on 1.21.11. `BCRenderTypes` and `BCCamera` own their Minecraft API differences. |
| `registry` | `BCRegistrationScope` owns Minecraft property/identifier/name stamping; loader registration remains in its existing platform adapter. |
| `components` | `BCItemData` handles registry-aware optional item serialization; loader-specific fuel/tool queries are not moved into it. |
| `recipe` | `BCRecipeDisplays` centralizes native recipe-book traversal and crafting-display input access without changing recipe eligibility. |
| `world` | `BCWorldHeight` exposes minimum and exclusive maximum height without pulling client camera classes into server code. |

### Persistence rules

- Never override vanilla `loadAdditional` / `saveAdditional` in a 1.21.X BCCE machine.
  Their signatures and exactly-once superclass calls belong to `BCBlockEntity`.
- Keep the existing schema: flat data on 1.21.1; common root fields and `bc_legacy`
  machine data on 1.21.11. Pipe holders, oil springs and quarry drill collision
  entities explicitly retain their already-shipped root layouts.
- Nested BCCE codecs may use `BCValueInput.tag()` / `BCValueOutput.tag()` with the
  supplied registry provider. This is an intentional transition escape hatch,
  not permission to recreate vanilla callbacks throughout the modules.
- An early save without registry context must not fabricate registry-dependent
  data. Root serializers that already work without it explicitly opt out of that
  requirement; in particular unknown pipe payloads must not be erased.
- Network update callbacks are separate from disk persistence. Do not mechanically
  rename methods on native `ValueInput` to methods of `BCValueInput`.

### GUI and rendering rules

Use the shared input boundary rather than duplicating native mouse/key record
bridges in each container screen. Internal recipe panels implement `BCWidgetInput`;
vanilla controls use `GuiEventListener`. Modifier scopes restore the previous
state even on nested callbacks or exceptions.

Geometry-only machine renderers implement `renderContents`. Deferred submission
must consume the already-captured vertices, not a live block entity. Keep special
native Tank/Pipe/Robot/Zone Planner renderers: this boundary is not a replacement
for their specialized render-state logic or for native item/laser submissions.

Canonical-source downports in `scripts/transforms/java_symbols.py` are restricted
to two reviewed Minecraft type aliases. The transform requires a matching import,
ignores comments/string/character/text-block contents, and never rewrites a method
body semantically. Other API differences belong to explicit Java boundaries.

### Validation and architecture constraints

```text
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p test_minecraft_compat.py -v
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p test_gui_regressions.py -v
python scripts/validate-12111-parity.py
python scripts/validate-regressions.py
```

The executable Java probes compile maintained classes against offline API doubles.
They do not replace a full Gradle build, real world save/reload, client rendering,
or dedicated-server testing. CI installs the Java toolchain required by each target; offline compatibility probes use Java 21 unless a target-specific probe requires otherwise.

Modern canonical Java targets 1.21.11; the 1.21.1 implementation is selected
through explicit downport views. Materialization uses mechanical transforms and
native loader bindings rather than class-specific source rewrites. The frozen API
exception in the 1.21.11 target overlay is intentionally retained.

## Internal platform boundaries

`buildcraft.lib.platform` is an internal implementation boundary, not public API
v2. Contracts and content/config descriptors are shared or family-owned; native
bindings stay in `source-platforms/<loader>`.

| Area | Internal contracts | Native binding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Items | `ItemStorage`, optional `MutableItemStorage` | `StorageAdapters`, `PlatformStorage` |
| Fluids | `FluidStorage<F>`, optional `FilteredFluidStorage<F>` | Lossless native carrier/boolean-action views |
| Energy | `EnergyStorage` (FE quantities, no unit conversion) | Native energy lookup/import/export |
| Events | `BCEvents` records and explicit tick phases | `PlatformEvents`, `PlatformClientEvents` |
| Content | `BCDeferredRegister`, `BCRegistryEntry`, `BCRegistryBinder`, `BCMenuFactory` | `RegistryBinding`, `PlatformMenus` |
| Configuration | `BCConfigSpec` schema and live value handles | `ConfigBinding` and native config events |

Storage adapters preserve native identity when unwrapped. This is required for
Tank/TankManager rollback and for NeoForge transactions; a new operation view must
not become a cache or invent a second transaction. Existing fluid carriers and
save formats are retained: `FluidStorage<F>` does not serialize fluid components
into a different representation. Provider capability exports, native item-fluid
containers, and Minecraft's native Fluid/FluidType classes remain loader-bound.
This boundary covers storage operations only; native storage types remain
loader-bound where required by the platform API.

Content catalogs preserve ID and definition order. Descriptor creation and bus
binding never execute a content factory. Factories run under native registry
lifecycle control; late definitions before the registration event remain allowed,
while the native freeze is still authoritative. The 1.21.11 registration scope
continues stamping block/item property IDs. Registry entries are not fake vanilla
`Holder` implementations.

Config builders record schema operations, including names, comments, ranges,
enum choices, defaults and world-restart flags. Binding creates one native spec;
value handles forward live getters so reload does not become a stale snapshot.
Module-specific reload filtering remains in the owning config class.

Gameplay tick/join/unload/watch callbacks receive normalized records and are
registered once. START and END phases are not coalesced: Transport's two distinct
phases are preserved. Client tick/login/logout bindings are client-gated; renderer,
model and screen registration remains separate. Permission actors, fake players,
and chunk-ticket management use their dedicated platform services.

Run `python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -p test_platform_boundaries.py -v`.
The test suite materializes all supported targets, compiles the real boundary
classes against small native API doubles, and checks the supplied baseline's
config fingerprints and literal content-registration order. It is not a full
Forge/NeoForge build or dedicated-server/client integration test.
